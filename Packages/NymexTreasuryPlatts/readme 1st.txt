This project does not load due to compatibility issue since it's built on visual studio 2010. Also the main package was previously renamed to platts.dtsx which is now again reverted and renamed back to ladwp.dtsx as a single package is used for platts, nymex and treasury import. 

If any modification is needed in the package then first, upgrade and rebuild the package in visual studio 2015 for ladwp.dtsx followed by your additional changes.
